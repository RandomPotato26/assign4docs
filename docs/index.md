# About [Widgets Inc.](copyright.md)

The strategic mission of Widgets Inc. is to produce quality scientific and technological 
advancements for common, everyday use. We are dedicated to making sure that our innovators 
consider the end-user (customer, consumer, etc.) at all costs. While we are a Fortune 500 company 
(NASDAQ: WINK) aimed at making sure our investors receive high dividends, and for them to feel 
proud at the human-centered innovations that arise from our company.

## Leadership
Our leadership team responds directly to our 30 member Board of Directors (who are made up of 
professionals from interdisciplinary fields beyond science and tech). The team is comprised of our 
CEO (Dr. Daniel Harmon), CFO (Dr. Robert Schrab), COO (Dr. Mundy Carter), CIO (Dr. Kurt 
Schuller), and CMO (Sean McKenna, J.D.). 
To accomplish our mission, our innovators act by these four tenants:

* Identify problems and possibilities related to humanistic endeavors important to our 
customer base. 
* Utilize technical design best practices. 
* Research issues thoroughly, ethically, analytically. 
* Report information professionally.

## History

Founded in Seattle, Washington in 1919, Widgets Inc. started out as Widget Tools LLC, known for 
making quality techno-science instruments. In 1956, then CEO Dr. Bo “Brains” Johnson bought 
several smaller communications and computation companies, expanding manufacturing and R&D.
Thus, the name was changed to Widgets, Inc. While Seattle serves as the world headquarters, there 
are research labs in Columbia, Missouri; Tempe, Arizona; and Oshkosh, Wisconsin (where Widgets 
Inc. partners with Oshkosh Truck and, formerly, Oshkosh B’Gosh).
